# Project CigSweep - cleaning the cigarette butts of the earth

This is me and my friends' project submission to Hack The North 2021. 
This repo is the machine learning model part, namely the initial Mark 1 product.


We trained a object recognition model specialized in detecting cigarette butts
using a dataset from Kaggel and YOLOv5.
This model can be used in environment clean up robots as a key component.


The trained results is in mark_1_results.zip

To re-create the results download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/estebanpacanchique/cigarette-butt)
and the two jupyter notebooks to your google colab and run them.
